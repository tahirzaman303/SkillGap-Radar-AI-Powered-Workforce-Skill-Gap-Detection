# SkillGap Radar

SkillGap Radar is an enterprise-grade AI decision-support system that performs semantic skill gap analysis between job descriptions and candidate profiles using Google Gemini 3 Pro.

## Problem
Traditional ATS systems rely on keyword matching, failing to understand implicit skill requirements, competency depth, and business risk.

## Solution
SkillGap Radar uses Gemini 3 Pro’s long-context reasoning to infer hidden skill requirements, compare them against observed competencies, identify critical gaps, and generate targeted learning pathways.

## Key Features
- Implicit skill inference
